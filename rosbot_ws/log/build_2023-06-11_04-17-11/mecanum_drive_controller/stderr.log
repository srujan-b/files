CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrealtime_tools.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "realtime_tools", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "realtime_tools"
  with any of the following names:

    realtime_toolsConfig.cmake
    realtime_tools-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "realtime_tools" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "realtime_tools_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "realtime_tools" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
